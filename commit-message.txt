feat: add dark mode support based on system preferences using next-themes

- Converted RootLayout to a client component to handle theme state properly.
- Integrated next-themes ThemeProvider with attribute="class" to toggle dark mode.
- Added useTheme hook to delay rendering until theme is mounted to prevent hydration errors.
- Enabled system theme detection with defaultTheme="system" and enableSystem.
- Disabled CSS transitions on theme change with disableTransitionOnChange to avoid flickering.
- Extracted metadata export to separate file to comply with Next.js client component restrictions.
