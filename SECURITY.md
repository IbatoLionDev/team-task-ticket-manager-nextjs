# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, Iâ€™d really appreciate a responsible disclosure.

Please **do not open a public issue**. Instead, contact me directly at:

ðŸ“§ **ibatoliondev@gmail.com**

When reporting, please include as much detail as possible:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce it
- Potential impact
- Any suggestions for a fix or mitigation

Iâ€™ll do my best to respond quickly and work with you to resolve the issue securely.

## Disclosure Policy

- I aim to respond within **48 hours**.
- If the issue is confirmed, Iâ€™ll develop and release a fix as soon as possible.
- Youâ€™ll be credited in the changelog if you wish.
- We can coordinate public disclosure once the issue is resolved.
